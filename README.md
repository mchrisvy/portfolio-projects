<summary><h3> Gravitational Wave Time Series Analysis </h3></summary>

Two short duration signals of the detection of gravitational waves had noises removed using Time series analytical techniques such as, pre-whitening and band pass filters. This isolated the chirp signals of the 
gravitational wave event detected form both sites A and B which was found to have time delay
between each other, 𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦 = 1.46 𝑚𝑠.

<summary><h3> Analysis of light curves </h3></summary>

Light curves are graphs that show how the brightness of stars changes over a period of time.

This project used the <a href="https://github.com/pmaxted/pycheops">PYCHEOPS </a> package to study binary stars and exoplanets.

My individual project was to analyse the accuracy of radii of stars with an ellipsoidal effect calculated by PYCHEOPS. The ellipsoidal effect warps the shape of the star and so must be studued carefully. I used <a href="https://www.physik.uni-hamburg.de/en/hs/group-schmidt/members/wichmann-rainer/nightfall.html"> NIGHTFALL </a>, an astronomy application to simulate the lightcurves of stars, more accurate than PYCHEOPS.
