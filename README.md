<summary><h3> Gravitational Wave Time Series Analysis </h3></summary>
Two short duration signals of the detection of gravitational waves had noises removed using Time series analytical techniques such as, pre-whitening and band pass filters. This isolated the chirp signals of the 
gravitational wave event detected form both sites A and B which was found to have time delay
between each other, 𝑡𝑑𝑒𝑙𝑎𝑦 = 1.46 𝑚𝑠.
